# Immersive Wisdom's Unity Test

Install Unity Hub for editing the project.

In Unity Hub, download the Unity version corresponding to the version in

`Unity\Immersive Wisdom\ProjectSettings\ProjectVersion.txt`

Upon opening the project, navigate to SampleScene and complete the Color Panel by implementing the following:
1. Introduce drag handlers on the top, bottom, left, right, and all 4 corners for resizing the panel.
2. The panel will always be contained in its bounded view.
3. The color UI controls will adjust size appropriately based on resizing of their panel.
4. Implement either the Color Wheel or RGB Slider for managing the camera's color (see below)
5. The controls do not need to precisely match the mockups but they should contain the same capabilities.
6. The controls should change their backdrop color to match what picking at that position would make the camera color.
7. The panel will be properly profiled and efficient.
8. Usage of external libraries and references is allowed.
